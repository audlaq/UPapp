The working title of this app is Unpolitics. The vision behind it is to transform the way politicians engage in their jobs by proving that in the internet age it is no longer possible to be inconsistent on a daily basis and get away with it. It hopes to serve as a quick, intuitive and simple way for anyone to view just the public statements made by any politician or candidate versus their actions, in order to form their own opinion.
